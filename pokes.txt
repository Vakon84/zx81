Ab better way is to start editing a new program with line 1 and a copyright note:
1 REM COPYRIGHT ...

Then do a POKE 16509, 40

That will change the line number to "A280", which can neither be edited nor deleted.
And because that is a big line number, all further BASIC lines will be inserted before that line, so the lines moves up in memory and cannot be found easily (to POKE it back to a valid line number).

POKE 16418,0

from within a program gives to 2 more lines at the bottom of the screen to be PRINTed AT (so the full screen 24x32 may be used by the program).
But set it back to the normal value 2, if you want to INPUT data (needs that 2 lines).
