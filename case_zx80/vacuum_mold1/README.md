## Summary

This is a first attempt at a vacuum form mold set for the Sinclair ZX80 computer.  The ZX80's case was originally vacuum formed from polystyrene sheets, only later becoming injection molded.

This is an attempt to produce simple molds that can be made to replace the original cases which have become very brittle due to their age, or for a new ZX80 replica.  The Sinclair ZX80 computer was produced by a company called "Science Of Cambridge" (Later renamed Sinclar Research) in 1980 and was powered by the Zilog Z80 Microprocessor and utilized 4k of Rom and 1k of Ram.
